## Project Description
The goal of this project is to implement a python program that takes an NFA as an input and outputs the equivalent DFA.

This process, called **Subset Construction**, is used to establish equivalency between NFAs and DFAs. This can also help us prove the regularity of languages and showcases the limits of finite automata.

Some real world applications of this process include:
- Formal Language Processing
- Hardware Modeling
- Compiler Design
